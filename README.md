# sapper-starter-template

A reduced fork of the sapper template with the things I usually want from the start actually working correctly (purgecss...).

Put together in a way where the goal is to statically export your site and not do SSR, so maybe SSR doesnt work, I don't care, use a better server than node to server your pages.
